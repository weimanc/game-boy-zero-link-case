CAD Order of operations

#helper parts:

screwpost:
- pad sketch
- mirror

speaker grill:
- master sketch_speaker_grill, one grill
- clone sketch and transform back to origin
- draft wb; array 6; sketch_speaker_grill
- pad; symmetric 10mm
- transform back
- cut with top-body  
- Z offset


Top:
- sketch-top-outline
- pad gbz_top_height
- boolean difference speaker cut
# make shell, thickness althernative
# https://old.reddit.com/r/FreeCAD/comments/v8qten/cant_add_thickness_feature/
- curves wb, select shell faces
- curves wb, misc -> parametric solid 
- 3D offset, -1.6mm, intersect
- create solid
- boolean difference (with the top body, the one that is a solid)
- fillet top edges gbz_fillet_radius
- union with screwposts
- cut with all cutout objects (screen, lcd, buttons, usbc)
- chamfer on insides (for strength)
- fillet holes for buttons
- union select buttons
- fillet dpad; ab


bottom
- sketch-bottom-outline
- pad gbz_bottom_height
# make shell, thickness althernative
- curves wb, select shell faces
- curves wb, misc -> parametric solid 
- 3D offset, -1.6mm, intersect
- create solid
- boolean difference (with the bottom body, the one that is a solid)
- fillet bottom edges 
  - gbz_grid_radius on bottom and corners edges
  - 2mm on top edge (gbz_fillet_radius too aggressive)
  - 2mm on insides
- cut grip texture
- union with screwposts


issues:
* button wall crashes in to button on the rp2040zero
* button wall prevents AB button to be inserted
- link port height (tolerance) need to increase to account the overhangs
- link port outer walls are very thin
- should create a 3rd part of the gameboy (think cartridge) to address the link port
* bottom screw pole is too tight, biting on the screw threads
* might want to reduce the length of the screw poles, so the screw force will translate to the shell walls
- overhang junk inside the LCD window.
* start/select was amputated off

Issues:
+ increase pcb-tol 0.3 -> 0.4
+ elephant foot, add chamfer:
++ link_base
++ button inserts
++ cartridge 
+ cartridge grooves lost in detail
+ bottom no screw holes
** caused by increasing gbz_bottom_height, but the offset001 is still stuck on old sizes
** cut holes
- link port vs pcb doesnt look right
* wall too thin, reduce with GBC width1 10 -> 9.8

- support on screwpost close the holes -> need to fix during slicing

* insert to button pivot

issues:
+ tolerance on link cut
+ increase cartridge stick up
